#  Preparation for Influenza Season
During the annual influenza season in the United States, a surge in flu cases necessitates extra medical attention, particularly for vulnerable populations, prompting hospitals and clinics to rely on medical staffing agencies for essential temporary support.
### Influenza Season Analysis
#### Objective and Scope
The objective of this project is to determine when to send staff, and how many, to each state to support hospitals and clinics during the upcoming influenza season.
The agency covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States, and the project will plan for the upcoming influenza season.
#### Datac Overview 
The project utilizes three key data sets: population data, influenza laboratory tests and patient visits, and influenza death data. These data sets provide insights into the demographics, disease trends, and mortality associated with influenza in the United States.
#### Key Questions
Which population is given importance?
Which states are currently facing risks?
When should staff be sent to each state?
